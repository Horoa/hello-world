# hello-world
My first repository, the start of my great adventure ! 

This account main's goal is to make me progress in programation.

I want all the green cells ! Meaning I have to code at least one time every day for a year !

I currently have no idea of what I want to code, but it'll probably be some 1 day or 1 week projects. 

If I have time i'll try a bigger project.

I want to progress in C++, python and java, so their gonna be my main programation languages.

What I really want to do : 
-A little game (a tactical RPG if possible)
-Some tools for my tableTop game
-Maybe some CSS code to improve my skill


What could be fun :
-Leetcode
-coding games

My secret and real goal is to become a better programmer than my Friend Wonshtrum ! I want to make him proud of me ! :D

If you're reading this and you're not me, it's a pleasure to meet you, I would gladly talk to you about anything (except the fight club).
